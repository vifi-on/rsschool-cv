### Summary: 
I graduated from courses on HTML&CSS, now I am actively studying JavaScript. I am sure that working as a front-end developer I will be able to provide myself and my family a better life. I think this activity is very interesting and exciting. There is no experience in this area yet. What motivates me is the dusty basement in which I now work 13 hours a day for $ 2 an hour.
